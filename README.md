# sorting an array with O(n) complexity


## Using the build-in function will cost us more than O(n) 
### Therefor i used a helper array
> ### The helper array size is as the max number in the main array.
> ### We take each number in the main array as index in the helper array and add number, it like we count how many number there is from each number in the main array .
## we do the same process for the negative numbers 
# All what need to do is print it .
 


#### note the function math.max finds the max number within O(N)
